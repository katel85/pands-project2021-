Backround on  the Fisher's Iris Data Set.

In 1936, Fisher published a report titled “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal Annals of Eugenics.In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. His evaluation was based on the measurement of the length and width of the petal and sepal (4 features) of three different species of the Iris flower. the species names were Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.Fisher himself did not take the measurements this task was assigned to a fellow colleague of his named Edgar Anderson. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
