Problem statement   

This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [3]. You must research the data set
and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to investigate it. An online search for
information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it
previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
You might do that for this project as follows:
    1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
    2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
    3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 



Backround on  the Fisher's Iris Data Set.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher’s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is a data dimesion reduction technique.When you are dealing with multi-dimensional data, you have data that has a number of features that are correlated with each other. If we plot multi-dimensional data in two or three dimensions, we are using the dimensionality reduction technique
