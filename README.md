Backround on the Fisher's Iris Data Set.

  In 1936, Fisher published a report titled “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal Annals of Eugenics.In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. His evaluation was based on the measurement of the length and width of the petal and sepal (4 features) of three different species of the Iris flower. The species names were Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.Fisher himself did not take the measurements this was conducted by a colleague named Dr Edgar Anderson. The Dataset is sometimes refered to as the Anderson Iris Dataset. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

  As shown in the above image, there are indeed similarities in morphology between these species. Thus, it’s interesting to note that the discriminant function developed by Sir Fisher in the 30's could solve this problem neatly from a statistical perspective. However, botanists have a better way to tell the difference between these species. In fact, Dr. Anderson himself published a manuscript titled “The Species Problems in Iris” to discuss the discrimination of Iris species. In the article, Dr. Anderson noted that the morphology of the seeds of these flowers was more informative. There is a noticeable difference in the seed size between these three species, in addition to the difference in the sizes of their petals and sepals.
  
  
  Fishers Iris Data set consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species 4 features. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus". I did try to research where the measurements for Iris Virginica came from but I was unable to locate this information. In Section VI of Fishers Article he noted 'Iris virginica, differs from the two other samples in not being taken from the same natural colony as they were-a  circumstance which might considerably disturb both the mean values and their variabilities'. It is of interest in association with I. setosa and I. versicolor in that Randoph (1934) has ascertained and Anderson has confirmed that, whereas I. setosa is a “diploid” species with 38 chromosomes, I. virginica is “tetraploid”, with 70, and I. versicolor, which is intermediate in three measurements,  though  not in sepal breadth, is hexaploid.  He has suggested the interesting possibility that I. versicolor is a polyploid hybrid of the two other species. We shall, therefore, consider whether, when we  use the linear compound of the four measurements most appropriate for discriminating three such species, the mean value for I. versicolor takes an intermediate value, and, if so, whether it differs twice as much from I. setosa as from I. virginica, as might be expected, if the effects of  genes are simply additive, in a hybrid between a diploid and a tetraploid species.
